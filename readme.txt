Update posts date automatically by setting the date to the current date.

== Description ==

** WARNING: DON'T USE THIS PLUGIN IF YOUR PERMALINKS INCLUDE DATES **

Why would you want to do this? Here are a few reasons:

1. New visitors to your site haven't seen your old content. This will help them discover it.
2. Old content won't show up in date-based searches on search engines, but resetting the date can make them look fresh again.
3. People like to share and link to new content and they determine that by looking at the publication date.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Update Posts Date to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Adjust the options as needed to suit your republishing schedule

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are posts duplicated? =

No. The date on posts is updated to the current date making a post appear new. URLs don't change and comments continue to display with the post.

= Doesn't changing the timestamp affect permalinks that include dates? =

Yes permalinks with dates would be affected. This plugin shouldn't be used if your permalinks include dates since those dates will change when a post is republished.

= Why do post slugs change upon republishing? =

This plugin doesn't alter post slugs. It changes the post date and, depending on the settings, changes the post's status. If you have other plugins that take actions when a post's date or status change, you may see some unexpected results. There isn't much I can do about the behavior of other plugins.
